# Description
Systems built around the principle of least astonishment (PLA) are not surprising.
They are designed to minimize the learning curve when interacting with a system
by taking advantage of existing conventions and historic traditions.

# Examples
- In Linux/Unix, a program based on PLA might have its files distributed
 according to the LSB. (config files in /etc, binaries in /usr/bin/, etc)
- A system built on PLA that is rebooted, would probably be not-surprising
and continue to do the function it was providing before it was rebooted? (auto-
start services)
- For operations, systems that are architected based on PLA would have the 
fewest inter-system interactions possible, to reduce surprising side-effects
of complex interacting systems.
