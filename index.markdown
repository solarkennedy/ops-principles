# What

What do we mean by 'principles'? A set of beliefs or philosophies that we
use to guide our thinking on how to design systems, networks and software
in a way to make them robust, operateable and maintainable.

In many ways, our principles are like software Design Patterns, but they exist
at a much higher level of abstraction. They are not specific prescriptions for
how to design or build things, but instead a set of guides to be used to evaulate
solutions against.

Sometimes adhering to all the principles is impossible (or at least so hard that
doing so is not pragmatic), and that's fine - it gives you a basis for making a rational
choice about which principle(s) you are abandoning and exactly why.

# Why

Because we care deeply about what we build and we want to be able to take pride in our work,
having delivered the best practical and pragmatic solution possible to any particular problem,
which will continue to be the best solution throughout the entire lifecycle of the system.

We've found ourselves continually explaining not just why
we're proposing a specific technical solution in favour of another,
but the entire rationale behind that choice, again and again.

We're not claiming to be truely original here - many or all of these principles
are 'well known' within some technical communities, however we've found that
they're not univerally known or understood.

This site aims to provide an easily digestable rationale behind them in one place,
with links to further material and research.

# Contributing

Contibutions (additions or fixes) to this site are **very** welcome. We don't have all the
answers, and we don't have all the right answers.

Please feel free to [open an issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) or send us a [pull request]({{ site.repository }}/pulls/)!

If you'd like to propose a new principle, we also have a [template](template.html)
you can use to start writing and help you structure it.
